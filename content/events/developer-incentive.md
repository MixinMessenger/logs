Mixin is impossible to succeed without developers, that's why we would prepare 10,000 XIN as the developer incentive for year 2018.

Developers can always help Mixin by contribute code or documentation to any repositories in our GitHub https://github.com/MixinNetwork.

In the future, besides those regular contributions, we will announce more developer events here with XIN rewards.

Prior to this announcement, there have been many developers working on Mixin. We will distribute about 50 XIN to appreciate their works.
