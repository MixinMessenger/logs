Mixin network is not only a fast and free distributed ledger, it also manages the most convenient and fast growing lighting network for other blockchains.

Though the ledger is free at most time, Mixin is designed to incentive the nodes in some creative ways. One of them is the miner fee for other blockchain transactions.

All blockchains assets can be transfered free within Mixin distributed ledger network, but fee will be charged when transfered out of Mixin network, and the fee is usally higher than that charged by the miner.

The differences between the fee charged by Mixin network and the miner will be shared among Mixin nodes and XIN holders as incentive.
