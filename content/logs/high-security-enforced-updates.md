Mixin has evolved a lot in security management during recent updates and will keep doing so.

There are always multiple Mixin versions supported at the same time, and to enforce security we have stopped supporting old versions prioror to 0.2.0 for both Android and iOS.

If you found any sign in or PIN incorrect issues, please update your Mixin app to latest version at first.
