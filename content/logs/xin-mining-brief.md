The maximum XIN supply is 1,000,000. Among them, 400,000 XIN have been distributed on BigONE exchange, 50,000 XIN to early Mixin Messenger adopters, and 50,000 XIN for the development team.

All the remaining 500,000 XIN will be coded as the incentives for all Mixin TEE-BFT full nodes and DAG light nodes.
