Many components of Mixin have been open sourced on our GitHub https://github.com/MixinMessenger, including the Android and iOS Mixin Messenger, Mixin cross-chain bridges, bot API client and network explorer, etc.

We will launch another invitation bonus campaign for GitHub developers, at least 10,000 XIN will be distributed in this campaign, valued more than $10M USD.
