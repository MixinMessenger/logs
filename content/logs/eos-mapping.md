The ERC20 EOS token in Mixin will not be automatically mapped to the EOS mainnet. However we just launched an official EOS mapping bot to help Mixin users to map their EOS without efforts.

To use the bot, users need to lock their EOS to the bot before 2018-06-01 12:00:00 UTC and the locked EOS cannot be unlocked before the EOS mainnet launch. The bot will also charge 0.5 EOS as miner fee per lock operation.
