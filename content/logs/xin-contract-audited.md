The XIN ERC20 smart contract has been audited by third party security organizations, the final result is excellent. We have passed all the 7 audit subclasses:

- Overflow audit
- Conditional competition audit
- Authorization control audit
- Security design audit
- Denial of service audit
- Gas optimized audit
- Design logic audit

There are several severe security vulnerabilities reported recently in some other ERC20 tokens, but none are seen in XIN.
